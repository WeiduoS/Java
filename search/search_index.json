File.pathSeparatorChar: Same as pathSeparator but it\u2019s char. getName(): Returns the name of the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname. getPath(): Converts this abstract pathname into a pathname string. getAbsolutePath(): Returns the absolute pathname string of this abstract pathname. getParent(): Returns the pathname string of this abstract pathname s parent, or null if this pathname does not name a parent directory. File Status exists(): Tests whether the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname exists. isFile(): Tests whether the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a normal file. isDirectory(): Tests whether the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a directory. length(): Returns the length of the file denoted by this abstract pathname.
